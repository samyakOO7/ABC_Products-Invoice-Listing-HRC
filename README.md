# ABC_Products-Invoice-Listing-HRC

This is a small 15 days journey project to understand more often working of High radius product invoice listing feature. A invoice is present with many columns from which we require only those which are essential to us in predicting the exact date when the product will get delivered or the invoice will get cleared. 

We prefer making a ML model which would help us in exploring and extraction of all the features present in the model and delivers to us the requirement i.e predicted clear date of invoice. We are given various date when the invoice was created and when payment is done etc of various customers of HRC.

Than we prefer entering all those values in ML SQL DB and connecting it directly to a website to show customers their preferred values in invoice listing

We also have an Add page, Edit Page, Search and Delete functionality for developer to perform crud operation on the data easily whenever required.
